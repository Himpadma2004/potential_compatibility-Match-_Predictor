potential compatibility (Love Predictor):

compat_raw = (w_sim * S_sim) + (w_person * S_personality) + (w_comp * S_comp)
compat_pct = (100 * compat_raw)  # scale to 0-100

🔹 Terms Explained

S_sim (Similarity Score)

Measures how similar two people are in lifestyle factors like:

Age

Education

Religion

Smoking/Drinking habits

Pets

Orientation, diet, etc.

Example: If Person A and Person B have very similar values → S_sim will be high (close to 1).

S_personality (Personality/Essay Score)

Based on their text essays/preferences.

We take essays, apply TF-IDF, and compute similarity (cosine similarity).

If both people write about travel, adventure, and movies → their S_personality will be high.

S_comp (Cluster Compatibility Score)

Derived from clustering model (KMeans).

Checks if both belong to the same cluster (similar type of personality/lifestyle group).

Example:

If they are in the same cluster → score is high.

If they are far apart in clusters → score is low.

Weights: w_sim, w_person, w_comp

These are weights assigned to balance the importance of each factor.

Example:

w_sim = 0.4 → Lifestyle similarity contributes 40%.

w_person = 0.4 → Personality/essay contributes 40%.

w_comp = 0.2 → Cluster group contributes 20%.

You can tune these weights based on experiments or domain knowledge.

compat_raw

Weighted sum of all three scores (before scaling).

Always between 0 and 1 if each S_x is normalized.

compat_pct (Final Compatibility Percentage)

Converts compat_raw into a percentage (0–100) for easy understanding.

Example: If compat_raw = 0.3611 → compat_pct = 36.11%.

👉 So in short:

Similarity → lifestyle match.

Personality → text preference/essay match.

Cluster → group-based match.

Weights → control importance.

compat_pct → final human-readable compatibility score.
